# ML-project

In this project we were given data (a number of features) about user sessions on an internet shopping site (Commerce-E).
Each session can end with or without a purchase. Our job is to build a system that predicts the likelihood of a certain user, under certain conditions, making a purchase while browsing the site.

In the project we will deal with the Binary Classification problem in which we have to classify records into two categories - whether a user is expected to purchase (1) or not (0), based on several features in the data set. Some of the features are known and some are anonymous.

I will note that we ended up with 92.2% accuracy.
